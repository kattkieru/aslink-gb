aslink-gb 0.5
=============

Fork of Dr. Tensi's modified SDCC linker with banking support from:
http://www.tensi.eu/thomas/programming/asxxx-linker/asxxxlinker.html

I've replaced their original Windows-centric build system with a cross-platform CMakelists.txt.  As this is intended to be part of my little [gbdk3 project](https://github.com/kattkieru/gbdk3), it installs to the project_root/../bin folder.
